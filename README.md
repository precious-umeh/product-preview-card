## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Two images were provided in this project, one for the desktop version and the other for the mobile version. I learnt how to apply the two images that it became responsive for both the mobile and desktop version by making use of the HTML source element and the srcset and media attributes.

Also, through this project i added an image into the anchor tag and also made it a flex container to align the image and text.

### Continued development

I look forward in making using of the HTML "source" element in subsequent projects to display images.
